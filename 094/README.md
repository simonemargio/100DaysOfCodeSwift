Creating a Minimum Viable Product

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
An excellent strategy to not immediately go to the development phase is to create an MVP, Minimum Viable Product.
No business wants to spend money on a product only to discover that it has no market. An MVP is an answer to innovative product development. Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a popular launch strategy that has worked wonders for big names like Dropbox, Figma, Uber, etc.

Rather than rushing to code the next big thing, create an MVP first. Determine your story and then explain what makes it unique. What is the value offered, and what is the problem you are solving? Here's a guideline for the step-by-step creation of MVPs.

The purpose of building an MVP is to launch a product quickly, based on an established idea, with a small budget. MVP development solutions allow businesses to collect users' feedback for the primary product and include it in future iterations. With an MVP, one can find the right audience, pull the ideas based on experience, and save time.

An example may be to develop a web app that can be deployed anywhere rather than going to develop the app for each system.
