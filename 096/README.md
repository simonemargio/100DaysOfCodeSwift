How to monetize your App


&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
In case the development process requires the monetization of the application, some considerations must be made.
- The monetization of your App must be considered before developing the application itself
- Determine the cost of developing the application from the outset. In this phase, it is necessary to take into account any delays that there may be on the development table, possible changes in the development of the app, changes in the market, and the demand for the app.
- Determine the cost of maintaining the application from the outset. This is an essential point because it leads many developers to create a completely free app and then find out that they don't have enough money to continue developing it or maintain the cost of the servers
- The strategy of releasing the free application, waiting for a large number of users to start using it, and then subsequently paying for it, is a strategy that can lead to more risks than benefits. This is because the majority of users, even if used to using the product, will feel betrayed by the fact that they have to pay for something completely free at the beginning. This leads to a migration of users to other services and the possible failure of the entire application
- If you want to monetize your app right from the start, you can implement a double-block strategy. A block of basic features are made free and allow the user to use the application without restrictions. Another block, on the other hand, will be paid and will introduce advanced features, the possibility of obtaining a summary of data, priority support, and other elements that can entice a free user to subscribe or pay for the app
