### Today's topic 🎯
Combine fonts


&nbsp;

### Note ✍️
- Serif and Sans Serif work very well together. Sans Serif has slightly increased legibility compared to Serif
- Never use only Serif or Sans Serif alone for all pages
- Too many fonts can mess up all pages
- Avoid mixing multiple fonts together
- Each font has its own purpose. Some fonts are more delicate while others strongly emphasize the words being written
