# Day 86

### Today's topic 🎯
Usability


&nbsp;

### Note ✍️
- Developing the idea is not the starting point but you must first understand if the initial idea solves a problem
- Identify the user you are developing for
- Eviscerate the idea into sub-ideas to have a clear situation of the procedures that will have to be developed
- Reanalyze the idea to find any issues or items to add
- Discuss all this not only with programmers or software developers but with people with various ideologies such as design, usability evaluation, statisticians, etc
