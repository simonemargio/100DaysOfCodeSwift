### Today's topic üéØ
Approach to UI Design and the importance of Alignment

&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- The use of fonts must be such as to guide the user's attention from the elements you want to the whole page
- Use elements like title, subtitles, paragraphs, media to keep the user's attention
- Pages with the use of a single font for all text leads the reader to lose attention and look elsewhere
- The alignment of the elements is crucial. Using spaces separates arguments and items. The spaces allow the reader to relax and then move on to the next element
- The elements must always be centered to maintain continuity and linearity
- The alignments must be based on simple and non-confusing geometry
