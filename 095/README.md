### Today's topic üéØ
Use crowdfunding to validate and finance your idea


&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
Are users willing to pay for your idea?
Having a good market share of users who are enthusiastic about your idea does not mean they are willing to pay for it. A possible solution is to build a Crowdfunding campaign.

- Through crowdfunding, it is not possible to validate your idea but also to finance it
- Crowdfunding allows you to get a good amount of initial money for the development of the idea and rewards users in the same way
- Among the rewards of the users there can be elements such as the use of the product at a lower price than it will cost once published, gadgets such as t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and the user's name among the thanks on the product page or in the product itself, the possibility of placing the user within the product itself and the like. The last point refers to a particularly small number of users who pay a large sum of money to have this privilege. Many crowdfunding campaigns allow 1 or 2 users, who pay a large sum of money, to choose, for example, the name to give to a character in their game, to choose how a part of the plot should develop, a trip paid for know all the development team behind the idea and other similar things

In essence, the method based on crowdfunding is one of the methods that allow you to have a win-win, on the one hand, the user receives a gift, and on the other, the company/team/group of people can get a good amount of money to develop his idea.
