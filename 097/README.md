When to use in-app ads


&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
Another method to monetize your service is to place line items in the product interface. In particular:
- Using in-app advertising allows you to keep the application completely free for all users but allowing the developer to earn money
- Ads should never completely mess up the user interface. One strategy may be to insert an advertising banner at the bottom of the interface
- Another strategy is to insert line items as if they were part of the interface itself. Examples like these are Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and other companies. The user will therefore use the application normally but after a certain number of interactions, an advertisement will be offered built in such a way as to be the same as the interface. For example, out of 10 tweets, an advertising tweet is proposed. The user will be less frustrated by this type of advertising as it is less invasive
- Many developers offer full-screen advertising that can't be closed unless some seconds pass. This strategy is unsuccessful because it leads to unnerving the majority of users who will look for other alternatives
