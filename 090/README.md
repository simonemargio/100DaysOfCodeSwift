### Today's topic 🎯
Idea validation


&nbsp;

### Note ✍️
- Idea validation is a fundamental process even before starting to develop any idea. This concept allows you to receive feedback if the idea can be really useful
- Each idea will lead to a loss of money but above all time in its development. Time is of the essence because if you work on an idea for a year and then discover that it is not successful, you have taken precious time away from any other ideas that could perhaps lead you to success
- How to understand if an idea is a good idea? Many are wrong by not validating their idea to those who will be the actual buyers and users of that idea
- The whole process will be: validate the idea -> create a prototype -> get traction (increase the number of end users who will use the product) -> raise funding
