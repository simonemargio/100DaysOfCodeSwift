### Today's topic üéØ
ViewController lifecycle

&nbsp;


### Notes ‚úçÔ∏è
- viewDidLoad()
	- The view is loaded. All IBOutlet and IBAction and others are linked to the view. This method is called only once, when the view is created.
- viewWillAppear()
	- Call soon after. Here you can set the various elements (for example show or hide the navigation bar). The user does not see this view.
- viewDidAppear()
	- This is the view the user sees.
- viewWillDisappear()
	- Called when the user interacts with the view. For example, it switches from one screen to another. If I am in screen A and click on a button that takes me to screen B, the viewWillDisappear() method is called before moving to B

- viewDidDisappear()
	- Last method that can be called to change the current view before the next one is loaded
