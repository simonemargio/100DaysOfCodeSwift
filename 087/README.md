### Today's topic üéØ
Simplicity and consistency


&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- Product design must maintain the concept of texture. If we talk about software, for example, the colors of the menus and buttons must all be consistent with each other (same shape, same design, same font, etc.)
- Maintain consistency even as the software continues to be developed with new features
- Do not redesign the whole product from scratch and then send it to the end user, but start with small changes so that the user gets used to the changes and can provide appropriate feedback on the changed functionality (having changed only one thing the user will be more precise in his feedback than a user whose entire interface is changed)
- Keep the concept of simplicity, with few elements on the screen, focus the user's attention where you want, and don't enter too much information to remember between one screen and another
- Simplicity is given in building a single road, beginning, development, and end. The user must understand when an action is finished
