# Day 93

&nbsp;

### Today's topic üéØ
The Landing page validation method

&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- In addition to the elements described in the previous days, building a validation page can be useful for getting feedback and interest from users on the idea you want to develop
- Having a web page allows you to survey the entire online world and get universal feedback on the number of people who are interested in the idea
- The key is to build a single web page that simply and quickly describes what is being developed without saying that it is under development but that it is ready to be released on the market. To obtain interest from users, the page may contain a form that allows the user to:
     - Get more information about the product
     - Know when the product will be released to the public
     - Access the product in priority over other users

The validation page must always be created before starting to write any line of code, this is because it is said that the idea is not revolutionary or arouses much interest from users. Therefore, only after having had the absolute certainty that the idea can take a good share of the market and that it has excellent potential for long-term development, do we proceed to develop the idea.
