Using Google Trends to estimate the size of your market

&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- Using Google Trends can be an excellent tool for evaluating the interests and searches carried out by users on the Google search engine. Being Google is one of the most used search engines in the world you can get a good number of information
- In addition to looking for a certain word it is possible to compare *interest over time* on one or more words. This meadow allows you to find what interests are most searched by users and to structure your idea in such a way as to enter the same user's research interest
- Another important element in the search for trends is to see if users are looking for keywords concerning your idea. Finding many correlations to your idea can lead to check if there are already other companies that have developed your idea or know that users are trying to find a solution that your idea solves. It is therefore a double-edged sword
- Google Trend also provides a detailed map of the world (also for nations, regions, etc) on the interest of users looking for a certain word. This information can be useful to establish where to start developing the idea and what is the best place to propose the idea itself

All this information is accessible by anyone free of charge. It is obvious that only users who use Google and not other search engines are considered, but for small businesses, Startups and only to start evaluating an idea, this information can be very useful.
