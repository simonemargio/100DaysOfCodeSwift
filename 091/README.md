The Simplest Way of Validating Your Idea - The Starbucks Method

&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- Feedback on an idea are fundamental for the operation of validating an idea. However, are there some considerations to be made, first of all, who to contact for feedback?
     - Through the construction of the personas we are looking for feedback on the idea from what the final users of the product will be
     - In addition to obtaining feedback on future end users, it is important to add an element of causality. Causality is given by obtaining feedback on the product from completely random users. Causality allows you to see from another point of view if the idea of the product is good or not. An end user already knows that they will use that product, while a completely random user can form an evaluation if the idea is really necessary
- Give total control to the user in providing feedback. Many companies tend to guide the user on a precise track therefore the user does not show his true consideration of the product. The user must be at ease and must understand that it is important above all to provide criticism and problems he finds in the product. Listening to critical feedback is the essential element to evaluate if the idea is valid
- Use The Starbucks Method: have any user, offer him a coffee to put him at ease, and talk to him that a third person has an idea. The last part is important because saying that you have an idea leads the user to always agree with you to be kind, instead saying that a third person has an idea allows the user to also be critical on certain points. Shown the idea that the user thinks what he thinks about it
