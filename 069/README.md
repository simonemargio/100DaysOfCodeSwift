### Today's topic 🎯
Swift structs vs classes

&nbsp;

### Note ✍️
- Structs
	- use stack 
	- are value type
- Classes
	- use heap
	- are reference type

- Structs pro
	- simpler
	- faster
	- deep copies
	- true immutability
	- no memory leaks
	- threadsafe

- Classes pro
	- Inheritance
	- Work with objective-C code
