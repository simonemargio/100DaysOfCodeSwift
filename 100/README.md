Your first 1000 customers

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
- The first customers who use your service are the most important. It is customers who build the reputation of your company/startup/application/etc, therefore they represent a fundamental element for the continuity of your product.
- The most difficult step for anyone is to reach the quota of one thousand customers. These represent people who believe in your idea and project and have decided to give it a try. Once you get an optimal amount of customers your project will start to grow within the market.
- The hardest phase for any project is at the beginning. Capital management, financing, development, no reputation, no indexing, etc put a strain on anyone.
- Beware that a large influx of clients does not always mean that your project is about to take off. For your project to survive what you need is not a million people who like you, but just a thousand people who love you. Although this reasoning may seem like an ideology, having a few people who love what you do compared to a million people who follow your project is very different.
The latter tend to use your product only out of curiosity, and most of them will then tend to abandon your idea. Instead, those who love your idea will follow it throughout its journey, these are the essential customers for any company.
- Six elements can be used to make the most of the market and make your project known:
    1. Email: create an email list of people who are interested in your project (for example by building what we saw on day 93: The Landing page validation method). Clients shouldn't be bombarded with emails, just get updates on what's going on behind the scenes of your project. You don't need to be specific but build a friendly text that will increase customers' desire to use your product.
    2. Blog: Writing a blog can be a great idea to increase people who are interested in your product and bind even more people who follow you. If you don't have the basics to build your blog there are alternatives like Medium. Posts don't have to be long and full of details but, like emails, they should encapsulate your passion for what you're doing and what's new about the product. The posts can be on a weekly or monthly basis, they can be a timeline of news or individual posts that contain thoughts and opinions that have affected the project.
    3. Launch site: to increase the number of customers it can be a good move to use products that already have a high number of customers interested in certain projects. Producthunt where you can talk about your project and get a good share of users and feedback on what you are developing. Betalist, if your product is in the beta phase, allows all interested users to register and try your product.
    4. Cross-promote: Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with the promotion of a related product. You can collaborate with people or companies who are in the initial stage of increasing customers, so you agree to promote the other's project to your customers. This strategy allows both elements (people/companies/startups) to significantly increase their clientele with each other's clients.
    5. Refer & friend: if you have built an email list it may be useful to "pamper" some of the most close-knit users to try the product with a referral strategy. The user can receive rewards such as priority access to try the product, initial discounts, welcome bonuses, getting to the top of the queue of people who will be allowed to try the product, etc. The more important the user feels, the more he will be tied to the product and will talk about it with his circle of acquaintances. Another example of a referral is based on inviting one or more friends to register for the product and then delivering rewards to the initial user as written above.
    6. Social media: Social media can be the driving force that allows your project to increase customers. Most people use social media, so building a brand of your product through these social media is crucial. Building relationships with other brands and companies on social media allows you to have a *cleaner* cross-promote. Clean in the sense that the user of company A is not forced to try the product of company B through advertising and/or other, but the basic interaction of the two companies on the social network is enough. For example, company A puts a *like*/*follow*/*boost* to company B. This interaction is much cleaner because users consider it as a basic form of the social network itself.
