How to get an App icon designed without breaking the bank


&nbsp;

### Note ‚úçÔ∏è
Whatever the design idea, having a *great* product icon is essential. By *excellent* we mean:
- The icon represents the business card of your application, it must be treated in detail
- The icon should depict what your application offers using minimal graphics
- Don't distort the icon by inserting too many details. A large number of details leads the user to not understand the purpose of the application, and therefore he will discard it
- The colors must be chosen to respect the uses and customs of the market in which the application will be proposed. Many peoples associate certain colors with various customs and traditions, therefore it is necessary to choose the colors of the application that do not conflict with these concepts
- The design must respect the existing design standards that users are used to. For example, developing an icon based on a design based on Skeuomorphism instead of simple and geometric shapes can lead the user to not consider the application because it is seen as an "old" design and in contrast with the design of all other icons

Developing the product icon is a very expensive process, in terms of time and above all costs. There are, however, some alternatives that can be included in the established costs such as any websites where you can pay a pre-established price for a designer who will develop the application icon.
