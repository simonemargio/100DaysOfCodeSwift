### Today's topic 🎯
Only on the App Store


&nbsp;

### Note ✍️
One strategy for releasing your project may be to initially make the application exclusive to Apple devices only. Although Android has the highest number of devices and therefore of people who could use your application, Apple users have a set of features that can increase the market share of initial users.  
These concepts are expressed simply and quickly in some slides, *Why iOS*, which I wrote a few years ago for a project.
